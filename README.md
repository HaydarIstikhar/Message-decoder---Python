# Message-decoder---Python
This Python script decodes a hidden message from a text file using a pyramid pattern. Each line contains a number and a word, which are stored in a dictionary. It extracts words based on indices (1, 3, 6, 10, etc.). For example, input like 1 Hello, 2 how, 3 are results in "Hello are". Ideal for uncovering hidden messages!
